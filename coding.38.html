<h2>The Will To Win</h2>

<h3>If you want a thing bad enough<br>
To go out and fight for it,<br>
Work day and night for it,<br>
Give up your time and your peace and<br>
your sleep for it.<br>
<br>
If only desire of it<br>
Makes you quite mad enough<br>
Never to tire of it,<br>
Makes you hold all other things tawdry<br>
and cheap for it.<br>
<br>
If life seems all empty and useless without it<br>
And all that you scheme and you dream is about it,<br>
<br>
If gladly you'll sweat for it,<br>
Fret for it, Plan for it,<br>
Lose all your terror of God or man for it,<br>
<br>
If you'll simply go after that thing that you want.<br>
With all your capacity,<br>
Strength and sagacity,<br>
Faith, hope and confidence, stern pertinacity,<br>
<br>
If neither cold poverty, famished and gaunt,<br>
Nor sickness nor pain<br>
Of body or brain<br>
Can turn you away from the thing that you want,<br>
<br>
If dogged and grim you besiege and beset it,<br>
You'll get it!
