<h3>He is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,<br>
That lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,<br>
But still lies pointed as it ploughed the dust.<br>
<br>
If we who sight along it round the world,<br>
See nothing worthy to have been its mark,<br>
It is because like men we look too near,<br>
Forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,<br>
Our missiles always make too short an arc.<br>
<br>
They fall, they rip the grass, they intersect<br>
The curve of earth, and striking, break their own;<br>
They make us cringe for metal-point on stone.<br>
<br>
But this we know, the obstacle that checked<br>
And tripped the body, shot the spirit on<br>
Further than target ever showed or shone.<br>
<br><br>-----Robert Frost</h3>
