<h2>The Road Not Taken </h2>
</div>

<div class="info1">
<div>
<h3>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both,<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood,<br>
And looked down one as far as I could,<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth.<br>
<br>
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there,<br>
Had worn them really about the same.<br>
<br>
And both that morning equally lay,<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>

I shall be telling this with a sigh,<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.
<br><br>-----ROBERT FROST</h3>
