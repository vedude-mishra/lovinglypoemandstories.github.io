	<h3>When Hemant realised that he was fail in his exams, he burst into tears and started thinking that how will his parents handle it as in his family everyone was smart and brilliant in every work. They never failed in any tasks ,and the same was expected of Hemant by Hemant’s parents . As he was walking back to his home, he saw a train was passing by the railway crossing he decided to COMMIT SUICIDE! Just as the train got very close to him, a hand came from behind and pulled him through his collar. Hemant got stunned by looking at the guy as he was his own father. Father asked Hemant that why he was doing so, Hemant explained to his father that since he failed in his exams, he can’t face the world and his parents. Father realised the condition of his child and took him to the jungle and told Hemant to look at the cocoon on the leaf. The cocoon was breaking and the butterfly was struggling to come out but it failed in doing but was continuously failing in doing so, but at the end it managed to come out. Father explained to Hemant that there is no problem in failing but we should not consider ourselves a failure. Father continued by saying that failing is also a part of success. Hemant realised his mistakes and had now a feeling of trying rather than failing.
