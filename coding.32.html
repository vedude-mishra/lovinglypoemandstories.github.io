<h3>Mummy mummy sometimes slaps on my cheeks,<br>
I felt very ashamed,<br>
But when once i silently walked in kitchen and saw you crying in alone,<br>
You noticed me and hide your tears,<br>
I never realized why you were crying .<br>
<br>
Daddy daddy sometimes i request to buy my favorite toy,<br>
And without hesitating you bought it to me,<br>
But when i saw your room door was little open,<br>
You were seeing your broken golf kit and were in tears,<br>
I never realized why you were crying.<br>
<br>
Sister sister sometimes i fight with you for a lollipop,<br>
In Spite it was yours i always try to get it,<br>
By seeing my hardship of getting it ,you purposely drop it and allow me to get it,<br>
But when i peep into your room i saw you with a certificate in your hand and saw you in tears,<br>
I never realized why you were crying.<br>
<br>
But when i grew up i understood that you all care for me,<br> 
And allow me to be happy by giving up your happiness,<br> 
And now the same is happening with me ,<br>
I always thought that why you were crying but ,<br>
Now i understood that my family always cares for me.<br>
