<h3>  
Forget the problems in life ,<br>
Enjoy your cup of tea ,<br>
Rather than being sad with your past ,<br>
Focus on your future rather be.<br>

Problems in past caused not by you,<br>
Its the mistake of your fate ,<br>
So rather being sad  ,<br>
Remember who are you.<br>
<br>
Every problem has its solution,<br>
Its just matter of time ,<br>
Rather enjoy your cup of tea ,<br>
Before it gets colder with time.<br>
<br>
Be happy always,<br>
Don't be in sorrow ,<br>
Try correcting your mistakes today,<br>
Rather waiting for tomorrow.<br> 
<br>
