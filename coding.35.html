<div class="info1">
		<h3>“Hope” is the thing with feathers,<br>
That perches in the soul,<br>
And sings the tune without the words<br>
And never stops - at all.<br>
<br>
And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard,<br>
And sore must be the storm,<br>
That could abash the little bird,<br>
That kept so many warm,<br>

I’ve heard it in the chillest land,<br>
And on the strangest Sea,<br>
Yet - never - in Extremity,<br>
It asked a crumb - of me.<br>
 <br><br>-----EMILY DICKINSON</h3>
